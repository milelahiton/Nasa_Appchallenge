🌍 Clean Breath – Every Breath Counts
"The air we breathe should not make us sick."
Today, 99% of the world’s population breathes air that exceeds the safety limits set by the WHO.
Each year, 7 million people die prematurely from diseases caused directly or indirectly by air pollution — heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer, chronic respiratory diseases.
And the most alarming part: most of these deaths are preventable if we act in time with accurate and accessible information.

🚀 Our Mission
In the information age, we can’t keep breathing blindly.
That’s why we created Clean Breath, a web and mobile application that forecasts in real time the air quality each person breathes, integrating satellite data from TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution), local ground measurements, citizen sensors, and meteorological conditions.
