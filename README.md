## 🌍 Clean Breath – Every Breath Counts
"The air we breathe should not make us sick."
Today, 99% of the world’s population breathes air that exceeds the safety limits set by the WHO.
Each year, 7 million people die prematurely from diseases caused directly or indirectly by air pollution — heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer, chronic respiratory diseases.
And the most alarming part: most of these deaths are preventable if we act in time with accurate and accessible information.
## 🦅Our Vision
To provide humanity with the most advanced tool to understand, anticipate, and improve the air we breathe.
Our app "Clean Breath" integrates space science, artificial intelligence, and public health to turn data into decisions — and decisions into hope.
Because on a planet where we all share the same air…
Every breath counts.
## 🚀 Our Mission
In the information age, we can’t keep breathing blindly.
That’s why we created Clean Breath, a web and mobile application that forecasts in real time the air quality each person breathes, integrating satellite data from TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution), local ground measurements, citizen sensors, and meteorological conditions.
## 💎Our Values
Our team is driven by the passion to improve the planet’s quality of life through innovation.
We believe in technology with purpose, applied to protect both health and the environment.
We are guided by a deep commitment to science, sustainability, and collective action.
We put our technological expertise at the service of people, transforming data into decisions that create real impact.
## 🌐 How It Works
Clean Breath combines the power of space observation with human collaboration:
TEMPO satellite data — we obtain real-time levels of NO₂, ozone, aerosols, and PM2.5.
Meteorological and local sensor data — we integrate information from ground stations and domestic or urban IoT devices.
Artificial Intelligence — a predictive model analyzes trends and projects the air purity index by hour and by area.
Scalable platform — designed to run from local devices to cloud infrastructure, ensuring global availability.
All this is visualized on a dynamic map "health” — where each user can see their surroundings in colors representing air purity levels, receive personalized alerts, and access recommendations to protect their health or modify habits.
## 🧠 Innovation and Purpose
Clean Breath not only informs: it activates awareness and collective action.
It enables:
User experience — the application allows users to upload their medical history, making it possible to personalize health recommendations and prevent diseases.
In this way, people with conditions that could be affected by pollution receive specific alerts and advice for their care.
Real-time alerts — for communities and municipalities when air quality drops to dangerous levels.
Data-driven public decisions — identifying the most critical sources of pollution.
Citizen motivation — encouraging ordinary citizens to become part of the solution by connecting their home sensors and sharing anonymous data.
Ease of interpretation — for everyday users through a friendly and intuitive graphical interface.
Thus, every breath counts, and every data point helps save lives.
## 💡 Impact
Clean Breath seeks to reduce daily exposure to pollutants, prevent diseases, and improve human quality of life, while helping governments and companies detect pollution sources and act on scientific evidence.
It is a tool that brings together NASA technology, citizen science, and artificial intelligence to build a cleaner and more sustainable future.
"If we can measure the air we breathe, we can change the history of our health and our planet."
